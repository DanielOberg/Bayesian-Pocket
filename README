Bayesian Pocket
===============

Fantastic command line utility that combines a simple bayesian filter and a linkcrawler for those
times when you don't want to show of your regexp knowledge but just want a simple linkcrawler that
can be trained to recognize what you want.

Example Commands
================

    add-source http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=daniel_oberg

    ls

    good 55

    bad 32

You can train it on specific files by piping a list with a line for each file like so:
find ~/Downloads/*.txt -type f -print0 | xargs -0 basename -s .txt | ./pocket
